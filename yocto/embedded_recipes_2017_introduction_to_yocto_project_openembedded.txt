Embeded Recipes 2017 - Introduction to Yocto Project/OpenEmbedded
=================================================================
Machines can be found in conf/machine folders
Distros can be found in conf/distro folders (check BSP layers for both machines and distros)
Try to do as little as possible in local.conf
yocto-layer create <layer_name> -o <dest_dir> - creates a layer
Using git repos for source code keeps good record.
Can make an image recipe, check recipes-core/images for examples
Create a machine
----------------
meta-<bsp_name>/conf/machine/<machine_name>.conf contains hardware description
use MACHINE = <machine_name> to set machine
TARGET_ARCH - architecture being built for
PREFEERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel - the kernel recipe to use
SERIAL_CONSOLE - speed and device for serial console to attach to
KERNEL_IMAGETYPE - zImage etc.
KERNEL_DEVICETREE - .dtb file
Make a README file for your machine
Example: conf/machine/fe-machine
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
require conf/machine/include/soc-family.inc
require conf/machine/include/tune-cortexa5.inc

TARGET_ARCH = "arm"

PREFEERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel ?= "linux-at91"
PREFEERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader ?= "u-boot-at91"

KERNEL_IMAGETYPE = "zImage"
KERNEL_DEVICETREE = "at91-sama5d3_xplained.dtb"

SERIAL_CONSOLE ?= "115200 ttyS0"
